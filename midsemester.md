### Question: Are there any correlations between COVID cases within colleges and within counties? Are the mask regulations for both counties and colleges involved with the number of cases?

**Conceptually, how do you propose to go about addressing this question?**
In order to approach the question I have, I would need to obtain the number of COVID cases within the colleges in the US as well as the number of COVID cases within each county in the US. I would also need to obtain the population numbers within the colleges and counties in order to compare the two by ratio. Lastly, I would need to obtain mask regulation data for both.

**What datasets did you use to answer these questions? Where did you get these from?**
College and county cases were both found from the new york times. I was able to find a dataset from kaggle containing info from the census bureau on county population. Lastly, I had a lot of trouble finding a dataset on college population, mask regulation in counties, and mask regulation in colleges, so for each, I went and did my own research by going to each college site or county to figure out which places have a mask regulation in place as well as the college population info.
